## What is it?

This repo contains the source code for my Portfolio / Personal Site build.  I
wanted to showcase my ability to produce a product that showcases a specific brand,
in this case my own. 

## Features

Some things to note: 

- I wanted to focus on Single-page content flow and design.
Creating a viewer experience that would not only let them see how I understand
experience / interface design,  but also my attention to detail and responsive design.
- If you look closely you will see that I did not use the css grid,
  this was to both learn how to utilize a seperately built grid system and be
  able to work with any type of layout tooling I may encounter in a workspace.
- Media Query usage goes hand in hand with not using css grid.  This was to
  enhance my understanding of what is percieved as a depricated technique but
  may have been utilized in a company's build.  Understanding the usage and
  implementation of Media Queries to me is important in identifying and understanding legacy
  code.
- Normalize.css was utilized as an alternative to CSS resets to manage cross-browser
  rendering and consistency issues.
